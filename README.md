# Python Notes App Tracker :rocket:


<h2>Project Overview</h2>


Hello Everyone or shall I say Hello World to my fellow programmers  :technologist:

This is a Web application using Python, Flask and SQL Alchemy that has allows Users to take Notes.

Users can do the following functions: 
 ✍️: Login

 ✍️: Sign Up

 📓: Create Notes

 ❎: Deleting Notes

For next time, I'd like to implement a feature where users are able to have an edit button where they can update exisiting Note instead of deleting and creating a new Note.
