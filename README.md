Hello Everyone or shall I say Hello World to my fellow programmers 🧑‍💻

This is a Webscraping project using Python and the Beautiful Soup package that covers the Top-Rated Anime Series from the IMDb website which may be of use to those who enjoy watching them like myself or are finding somewhere to start!

Details
I decided to create this project because not only am I currently learning Python, but I also introduced my friends to Anime and they themselves were not sure on where to start so I decided - "Hey, Why not put my Python skills into a real-case use" 💡

The excel spreadsheet (.xlsx) contains the anime list which the data was parsed from using the Beautiful Soup package in the scraper.py that includes the code of grabbing the key contents such as:

🏆 Rankings

📛 Anime Titles

📆 Anime Release Dates

🌟 Anime IMDb Ratings 🌟

Summary
I really enjoyed creating this and learned alot from it although it was difficult in the start with all the syntaxes and Python-specific functions (due to transitioning from JavaScript), but after alot of researching and countless tutorials - I persisted and finally got an end result !

Nevertheless, I hope whoever may use and/or see this, please feel free to use my code as I wrote comments to guide ! 👐
